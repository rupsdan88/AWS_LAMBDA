************AWS LAMBDA LAB **************
NEED AWS IAM ROLE, S3 BUCKET, DYNAMO DB, LAMBDA Services.

Step1:
- Create IAM Role for Lambda and give dynamodb full access.
Step2:
- Create Lambda Function choose Author from scratch and then choose python 3.6 language
- Enter Following Code

import boto3
from uuid import uuid4
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3 = boto3.client("s3")
    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
    for record in event['Records']:
        bucket_name = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
        object_key = record['s3']['object']['key']
        size = record['s3']['object'].get('size', -1)
        event_name = record ['eventName']
        event_time = record['eventTime']
        dynamoTable = dynamodb.Table('newtable')
        dynamoTable.put_item(
            Item={'unique': str(uuid4()), 'Bucket': bucket_name, 'Object': object_key,'Size': size, 'Event': event_name, 'EventTime': event_time})

Step3:
- Create S3 Bucket 

Step4:
- Go to Lambda and Add Trigger as a S3 and its bucket and choose all events

Steps5:
- Create DynamoDB table, table name as mention in above code(newtable) and primary key is (unique)

Now Your Connection has been done, Lets check the code is working or not, You have to upload data/file to the s3 bucket and then check lambda will trigger this event with dynamo db
- Go to dynamo db and and check table status will get entry for data has been added into s3 bucket
